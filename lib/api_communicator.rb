  # iterate over the character hash to find the collection of `films` for the given
  #   `character`
  # collect those film API urls, make a web request to each URL to get the info
  #  for that film
  # return value of this method should be collection of info about each film.
  #  i.e. an array of hashes in which each hash reps a given film
  # this collection will be the argument given to `parse_character_movies`
  #  and that method will do some nice presentation stuff: puts out a list
  #  of movies by title. play around with puts out other info about a given film.
